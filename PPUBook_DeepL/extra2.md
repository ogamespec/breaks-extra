# How to open a chip

There are several ways to remove the chip from the chip case.

The most common one is to use acid.

This post describes another way to avoid working with acids, because acids require knowledge of certain safety techniques and are generally not fun.

## Preliminary Steps

The first thing to do is to unsolder or bite off the legs of the chip with a wire cutter. You can not worry about the safety of the chip legs, because the operation of extracting the chip is disposable :smile:

Then you need to determine where the chip is under the plastic and saw out the necessary piece with a dremel.

Usually there is a copper heat sink plate on the back side of the chips, which is slightly larger than the crystal. (The chip itself is usually glued to this plate).

The operation should be carried out in a mask, as the dust from the plastic does not smell very nice.

The result should be something like this bun:

## Thermal opening method

The following tools are required for the subsequent operation:

- Gas torch
- Mask
- Pliers

After that, you need to go outside, in a deserted place, clamp a piece of the chip casing with pliers and direct the jet from the gas torch.

WARNING! It is very desirable not to inhale the smoke from the burnt plastic of the chip case. It can cause pulmonary edema and is harmful. If you have ever smelled burnt wires, you can imagine how the fried chip body will smell.

You have to fry it until it is ready.

You can tell if it's ready when instead of black plastic there is only gray ash, like this:

Now all that's left to do is to use a pickaxe to carefully crush the fried case and the chip crystal will fall out of it.

## Pitfalls

The following troubles may occur in the process:

- The crystal may crack crosswise. This is actually not so bad, the cracked pieces can be combined under a microscope and still retrieve the necessary data
- A crystal can crack lengthwise (split). This is very bad. A chunk that has delaminated cannot be restored. Cracking of the crystal can occur if you actively pry it from one side while extracting it.
- The chip is not cooked all the way through. In this case it may be covered with black fouling. This is not very nice either, but usually you can still see the surface of the chip through the soot.

Below are pictures of different kinds of troubles:
